# Configurable onboarding app

Configurable onboarding application using React and Typescript.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Examples
To see how dynamic the system is, I left some examples internally mocked.

`
src/view/Onboarding/Onboarding.tsx
`
```javascript
import { client } from '../../mocks/client1';
// import { client } from '../../mocks/client2';
// import { client } from '../../mocks/client3';

```
You can comment and uncomment for testing and you can also add your configuration like the other examples.
